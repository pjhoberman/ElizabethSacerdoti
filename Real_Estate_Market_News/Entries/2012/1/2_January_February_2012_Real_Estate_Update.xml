    <richText>&lt;b&gt;My Move to Kentwood Real Estate&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;This month marks my professional move over to Kentwood Real Estate.  I am so excited to join their Cherry Creek office and their exceptionally talented group of real estate brokers.  Kentwood offers one of the strongest, most respected names in Denver Real Estate.  We&#x2019;ve also officially partnered with Christie&#x2019;s International Realty to offer our clients the finest marketing opportunities.  Although I will deeply miss many incredible brokers and friends at Sotheby&#x2019;s, I look forward to my new venture and the many new resources  I will be able to offer my clients. &#xD;My new contact information is as follows:&#xD;Email: &lt;a href="mailto:Elizabeth@DenverRealEstate.com"&gt;Elizabeth@DenverRealEstate.com&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;New Work Address: 44 Cook St, 9th Floor, Denver, CO.  My cell phone is still &lt;b&gt;303.501.3337.&lt;/b&gt;&#xD;&#xD;&lt;b&gt;Sales Statistics for 2011&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;Here&#x2019;s all you need to know about your neighborhood:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&lt;b&gt;Condos&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;When buying a condo, realtor&#x2019;s have a much tougher job for their clients than ever before.  This is in part due to the mountains of information they must review to ensure the condo development has FHA approval.  Even if you don&#x2019;t get an FHA loan, this will certainly affect your ability to sell down the road, so make sure you know ALL the facts before buying a condo.  I can help with that : )  For more information about this, check out this Denver Post article: &lt;a href="http://www.denverpost.com/search/ci_19789026"&gt;Article on FHA Approval and Condos&#xD;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;The Houses and Buildings of Peru&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;As many of you know, I took a trip to Peru in November of this year and I wanted to share a few pictures I took.  The real estate broker in me couldn&#x2019;t stop noticing the housing.  For more pictures of the trip, please check out my facebook page.&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;</richText>
