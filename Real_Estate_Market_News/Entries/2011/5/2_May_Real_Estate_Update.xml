    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Denver Market in Review&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;We&#x2019;re still in a buyer&#x2019;s market with prices that have remained quite low.  However, sales are quickly outpacing new inventory, which is great news for sellers too as prices will likely rise moving into summer and days on market will decrease.  Condos still have on average most days on market (about 5 months), but both single family homes (just over 4 months) and condos are seeing those numbers decrease.  Overall, this is a positive trend that we&#x2019;re seeing in many markets, and will hopefully bring both sellers and buyers into the market over the summer.  The graph below shows price trends in Denver year over year.&#xD;&#xD;&lt;b&gt;What&#x2019;s happening to real estate in the rest of the world?&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;I mostly talk about what I know best- the Denver market. However, I&#x2019;ve been wondering lately about what&#x2019;s been larger impact on housing around the globe.  Like us, some of the world has been experiencing a decline in real estate.  Places like  Dubai and Ireland showed quarterly declines of home sales of -6.1% and -3.5% respectively.   However, there are a few places that went up in the last year-  most notably, Hong Kong- up 20.1% annually and Latvia (of all places!) up 16.9%.  Europe was mostly split- France showed growth in the housing market, while Italy fell slightly.   Overall, most of the world had positive housing numbers, and only 16 of the 49 countries reported in this study showed a negative annual change.  As we move past the vestiges of the mortgage crash, I can only hope the USA( -4.1%) will be on the positive side rather soon.&#xD;&lt;b&gt;Great Opportunity in Colorado Springs&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;The photo above represents a fantastic home for sale in Colorado Springs.  Priced at $279,900, this 6 bedroom, 4 bath home has over 3300 square feet.  With views of the mountains and two master suites, it&#x2019;s being offered at a phenomenal price!  Call with any questions.&#xD;&lt;b&gt;Best App in Real Estate&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;I&#x2019;ve tried them all and the best one I&#x2019;ve seen is the Sotheby&#x2019;s Iphone App.  Accessible all over the world, this app shows you what you want to know the fastest- map, photos, and basic info about properties for sale or rent in your area..&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;</richText>
