    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Where to Live? &#xA0;The best value Denver &#x2018;hoods&lt;/b&gt;&#xD;&lt;i&gt;5280 Magazine &lt;/i&gt;annually publishes a great article about the best central Denver neighborhoods . &#xA0;In fact, here&#x2019;s a link to their last article.   &lt;a href="http://www.5280.com/magazine/2010/05/where-live-denver-now?page=0,1"&gt;5280 Magazine Article&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;I totally agree with their choices this year. I would further comment that they almost all have one thing in common. &#xA0;They all border neighborhoods that historically have been very strong. &#xA0;The reason for this trend is that over-speculation of these neighborhoods- the Highlands, Wash Park East, Cherry Creek- was unsustainable through the recession. &#xA0;However, these peripheral areas have been strong investments for buyers in the last 18 months. &#xA0;Long term, these investments will absolutely pay off as buyers benefit two fold- they also got incredible interest rates on neighborhoods that have no where to go but up. &#xA0;&#xD;&#xD;Check on your Denver neighborhood&#x2019;s current real estate trends at:   &lt;a href="http://fullersothebysrealty.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/denvermetrofsirmicromarketreport_july20112.pdf"&gt;Denver Market Trends&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xD;Check your Boulder neighborhood here:  &lt;a href="http://fullersothebysrealty.wordpress.com/hows-the-market-in-metro-denver/micro-market-real-estate-reports/boulder-micro-reports/"&gt;Boulder Market Trends&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xD;And for you mountain mountain lovers- here&#x2019;s the Vail Valley:  &lt;a href="http://fullersothebysrealty.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/vailvalleyfsir-micromarket-report_q22011_web.pdf"&gt;Vail Valley Market Trends&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xD;&lt;b&gt;What&#x2019;s Happening with New Construction?&lt;/b&gt;&#xD;The United States Census Bureau listed Denver as #20 for new housing construction projects in 2010. &#xA0;The study involved 366 metro areas and the total number of permitted and approved building projects. &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Houston, Dallas and New York City rounded out the top three, while Colorado Springs ranked #42. &#xA0;This is very positive news for Colorado as new construction tends to be a strong indicator of overall economic health.&#xD;&#xD;&lt;b&gt;What&#x2019;s happening with Colorado foreclosures?&lt;/b&gt;&#xD;They are declining! &#xA0;The second quarter showed a 30% reduction over the second quarter last year for new filings for foreclosures. &#xA0;This means that some &#xA0;the inventory that has been held by banks is slowly tapering off. &#xA0;Over time, this will bring the market further into balance as we see declines in the massive amount of bank inventory that flooded the market in the last two years.&#xD;&#xD;&lt;b&gt;What to know about your credit report&lt;/b&gt;&#xD;Parking Tickets can now show up on your credit report! &#xA0;Beware! &#xA0;If you see an error somewhere on the report, discuss whether or not you should dispute the charge or simply pay it to make it disappear. &#xA0;The timing on fighting credit report errors can be the difference between closing on your home or staying in your rental. &#xA0;Only your lender can guide you on how this can affect you.&#xD;&#xD;&lt;b&gt;Denver Sold Statistics- August 2011&lt;/b&gt;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;</richText>
