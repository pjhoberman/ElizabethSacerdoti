    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Real Estate Market in Review&lt;/b&gt;&#xD;Since the market&#x2019;s underperformance early in 2009, the last nine months have actually seen an increase in pending home sales.&#xA0; In Denver, for example, housing sales surged 23% in November alone over the same month in 2008.&#xA0; The market is starting to stabilize and consumer confidence has been growing.&#xA0; With the federal government stepping in with a wide variety of laws that will help consumers understand more about their mortgages and help people stay in their homes, real estate professionals are being held to a higher standard.&#xA0; If you haven&#x2019;t bought or sold a home in the last three years, I think when you return to the market, you will notice a positive change in contracts, disclosures and service.&#xD;&lt;b&gt;Tax Credit- Running Out!&lt;/b&gt;&#xD;Whether you are an existing homeowner or a first time buyer, this tax credit really is a fabulous opportunity to make a move!&#xA0; In order for you to qualify for the tax credit, you must buy a primary residence and you must be under contract on the property by April 30th, 2010.&#xA0; Additionally, the income limit recently doubled, so even if you weren&#x2019;t a candidate before, you may be now.&#xA0; You don&#x2019;t have to close on the house until June 30th--however, get out there and start looking if you want to take advantage of the $8,000 tax credit.&#xA0; Please email me directly for more specifics on the eligibility requirements.&#xD;&lt;b&gt;Short Sales and Foreclosures- Expert Advice&lt;/b&gt;&#xD;Short Sales, a word most people didn&#x2019;t know a year ago, means when the bank agrees to sell a home for less money than the balance on the current loan.&#xA0; With short sales and foreclosures representing a significant percentage of the market share of most neighborhoods, now is a critical time to be informed about how these properties differ from traditional sales.&#xA0; As a result, I have recently become certified as a Short Sale and Foreclosure Resource.&#xA0; If you have been thinking about investing in a short sale or are if you are interested in your options should you be behind in a mortgage payment, I&#x2019;m available to answer your questions.&#xA0; As of April 2010, new federal laws will be put in place in an effort to streamline the time-consuming short sale process.&#xD;&lt;b&gt;Happy New Year!&lt;/b&gt;&#xD;For many people, the New Year is the perfect time to make plans for the coming year.&#xA0; If your plans include thinking about buying or selling a home, consider contacting me in advance to talk about your situation.&#xA0; Being prepared and knowledgeable about your real estate market is one of the easiest and best ways to sell a house or find the house of your dreams.&#xD;&lt;b&gt;Property Up Close: Villa in the heart of Provence&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&#xD;&#x201C;La Fleur de Lys&#x201D; is a spectacular Proven&#xE7;al villa overlooking the Meditteranean Sea in the town of La Croix Valmer, France.&#xA0;&#xA0;Located a mere fifteen minutes from the famed port town of St. Tropez, this home is situated in the heart of the very best part of Provence.&#xA0;&#xD;&#xA0;&#xD;Enclosed by private electric gates, this 3 bedroom, 3 bath home also has additional sleeping space to accommodate up to 12 adults.&#xA0;&#xA0;The home is fully equipped with modern conveniences ranging from an American style kitchen to wireless internet and Sky TV.&#xA0;&#xA0;A large sliding glass door in the dining room can be pulled back into the wall, opening up the entire house to the large terraced patio.&#xD;&#xA0;&#xD;The large lot features a state of the art, heated illusion pool with a panoramic view of the sea, many levels of tiled terraces, a double-sized boules court and fabulous views of the Meditteranean Sea and surrounding vineyards.&#xA0;&#xA0;The garden, on an automatic watering system, has been beautifully landscaped with old olive trees, palm trees and exposed levels of an antique stone wall.&#xA0;&#xD;&#xA0;&#xD;Price upon request.&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&lt;b&gt;Elizabeth Sacerdoti&#x2028;&lt;/b&gt;Fuller Sotheby's International Realty&#x2028;3033 East First Avenue, Suite 500 Denver, CO, 80206&#x2028;p:-303-501-3337&#x2028;&lt;a href="http://www.FullerSothebysRealty.com"&gt;www.FullerSothebysRealty.com&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;</richText>
